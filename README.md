# MegaTinyEngine

Mega Tiny Engine is a small work-in-progress 2D game engine written in modern C++. 

The engine is a hobby engine meant to make me more productive in making small casual indie games, rather than relying on one of the huge all-in-one engine solutions like Unreal, GoDot and Unity, and at the same time making me code in C++ as opposed to various scripting languages used in other engines. Thus the small feature-set.

I develop the engine in tandem with a couple of small example games, as this has turned out to be a great productive and fun way for me. I therefore only add features once i actually need them in a game, and many obvious and common things might therefore be missing.


## Features

- Scene tree
- AABB collision
- Kinematics
- Sprite animation
- Bitmap text
- JSON based resource loading

## Dependencies:

- SDL for rendering
- https://github.com/nlohmann/json for handling JSON.
